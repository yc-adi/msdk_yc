# ImgCapture

![Example Image Capture in VSCode](res/Example-Capture.png)
(Above:  352x352 capture of a test pattern using the MAX78000FTHR's OV7692 camera)

## Description

This example demonstrates how to capture an image using the PCIF peripheral and Camera drivers.  It also demonstrates a method for collecting high resolution images and sending them to any arbitrary output destination, such as a UART interface or SD card.  

Collecting images can be a challenge when dealing with low-power CMOS camera sensors, which usually don't have memory buffers of any significant size.  Most will internally buffer a single row and then immediately stream it out to a high-speed Parallel Camera Interface (PCIF).  As a result, exposure time is proportional to the clock speed of the camera.  Therefore, the host microcontroller must be able to process, forward, and/or store the incoming image data within the strict timing limitations imposed by the camera module.  The limited general purpose SRAM size of microcontrollers make alternate output destinations (host PC, external memory, SD card, etc.) attractive, but these often have much lower bandwidth than the PCIF peripheral.  Slowing the PCIF clock speed can work for these, but is not an ideal solution because of the relationship between clock speed and exposure time.

In order to collect useful high resolution images, the 512KB of data SRAM in the MAX78000's CNN accelerator is stitched into a virtually contiguous data buffer.  From there, the data can then be forwarded on to any secondary destination by the host firmware.  This method requires cusof the PCIF peripheral.  The implementation can be found in [src/cnn_memutils.h](src/cnn_memutils.h).  High-level usage examples for supported output destinations can be found in [src/main.c](src/main.c).

The example can perform standard blocking captures up to the memory limits of the device, and streaming DMA captures (using cnn_memutils) up to 352x352, including QVGA (320x240) at max camera clock speeds.  Image captures are controlled from a host PC running [utils/console.py](utils/console.py).

It supports the following output destinations:

* Transmit image to a host PC.

* Save image to SD card.

## Building, Flashing, & Debugging

For instructions on how to build, flash, and debug this example see [.vscode/readme.md](.vscode/readme.md).

## Console Interface & Utilites

For more details on running the serial console, converting images, and excercising the example, see [utils/README.md](utils/README.md)

## Build Notes

Full documentation on the build system can be found in the "Build Configuration" section of [.vscode/README.md](.vscode/README.md#build-configuration).  The following notes contain important quick-start info.

### Enabling Firmware Features

Firmware features can be toggled in [src/example_config.h](src/example_config.h).

* The console is enabled by default.  It will wait for a valid connection from [utils/console.py](utils/console.py) on startup.

* SD card functionality is disabled by default.  It will attempt to mount the SD card on startup using the FAT32 format.  If it detects a blank card has been inserted (the drive name is empty) then it will attempt to format the card to FAT32.

After making any changes, fully clean the project and then rebuild.

### Setting BOARD Correctly

Before you build, ensure you've set the `BOARD` value to match your evaluation platform.

For the MAX78000EVKIT, use `EvKit_V1`.
For the MAX78000FTHR, use `FTHR_RevA`.

**Where exactly you set `BOARD` will depend on your development environment.**

* If you're developing on the command-line, set this value in [project.mk](project.mk) or on the command-line (`make BOARD=FTHR_RevA all`)

* If you're developing with Visual Studio Code, set `"board"` in [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json).  See the VSCode-Maxim [readme](.vscode/readme.md) for more details.

* If you're developing with Eclipse, set the `"BOARD"` environment variable.  Right click project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Environment -> `"BOARD"`.  Apply, clean, and rebuild.

### Setting CAMERA

The `CAMERA` variable in [project.mk](project.mk) is used to select the correct drivers for the attached camera.  When this variable is changed, you should also ensure the `CAMERA_xxx` compiler definitions in [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) is also changed to match.  The project settings cannot automatically changes in the compiler definitons to match the camera.

## HM0360 (Mono) Quick-Start

This quick-start is applicable for the [HM0360-MWA](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/himax/HM0360-MWA/14109823) **mono** sensor.

1. Set `CAMERA=HM0360_MONO` in [project.mk](project.mk)

2. [Clean and rebuild](.vscode/README.md#build-tasks) the firmware.

3. Connect the PICO debugger to the SWD port (JH5) and a micro-USB cable to CN1.

7. Run a standard `capture` with default settings.

    ```shell
    $ capture

    MCU: Configuring camera
    MCU: Capturing image
    MCU: Done! (Took 646721 us)

    ```

    ![HM0360_320_240](res/HM0360_320_240.png)

8. Decrease image resolution and recapture.  The HM0360 requires switching the active context to one that has been configured for the target resolution.

    The active context can be retrieved from register `0x3024`.

    * `0x3024 = 0` shows Context A is active (320x240).
    * `0x3024 = 1` show Context B is active (160x120).

    ```shell
    $ get-reg 0x3024

    MCU: Camera reg 0x3024=0x0
    ```

    To change to Context B (160x120):

    ```shell
    $ set-reg 0x3024 1

    MCU: Writing 0x1 to camera reg 0x3024
    $ imgres 160 120

    MCU: Set image resolution to width 160, height 120
    $ capture

    MCU: Done! (serial transmission took 206999 us)
    ```

## HM0360 (Color) Quick-Start

This quick-start is applicable for the [HM0360-AWA](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/himax/HM0360-AWA/14109822) **color** sensor.  In practice, this is the same sensor hardware as the "MWA" mono variant but with a bayer-patterned color filter.  As a result, de-bayering functions are required to reproduce the color image.

1. Set `CAMERA=HM0360_COLOR` in [project.mk](project.mk)

2. [Clean and rebuild](.vscode/README.md#build-tasks) the firmware.

3. Connect the PICO debugger to the SWD port (JH5) and a micro-USB cable to CN1.

4. Power on the board take note of the COM port presented by CN1.

5. [Flash & run](.vscode/README.md#build-tasks) the firmware.  LED1 on the board will be blinking.

6. Connect [console.py](utils/README.md) to the COM port presented by CN1.

    ```shell
    $ python console.py COM19

    Started ImgCapture console and opened COM19
    MCU: *SYNC*

    MCU: Initializing camera
    MCU: Camera I2C slave address: 24
    MCU: Camera ID detected: 0360
    MCU: Ready!
    $
    ```

7. Run a standard `capture` with default settings (Malvar-He-Cutler debayering).

    ```shell
    $ capture

    MCU: Configuring camera
    MCU: Capturing image
    MCU: Done! (Took 98776 us)
    MCU: Captured 160x120 BAYER image to buffer location 0x20001b98 (19200 bytes)
    MCU: Debayering complete. (Took 32186 us)
    MCU: *IMG* RGB565 38400 160 120
    Collecting 38400 bytes...
    Saved image to 'C:\Users\JCarter3\repos\msdk\Examples\MAX78000\ImgCapture\utils\Image.png'
    MCU: Done! (serial transmission took 413863 us)
    ```

    ![HM0360_MalvarCutler_320_240](res/HM0360_MalvarCutler_160_120.png)

8. Change the debayering function using `set-debayer` and recapture.

    ```shell
    $ set-debayer bilinear

    MCU: Set bilinear
    $ capture

    MCU: Configuring camera
    MCU: Capturing image
    MCU: Done! (Took 89870 us)
    MCU: Captured 160x120 BAYER image to buffer location 0x20001b98 (19200 bytes)
    MCU: Debayering complete. (Took 11196 us)
    MCU: *IMG* RGB565 38400 160 120
    Collecting 38400 bytes...
    Saved image to 'C:\Users\JCarter3\repos\msdk\Examples\MAX78000\ImgCapture\utils\Image.png'
    MCU: Done! (serial transmission took 413747 us)
    ```

    The 'malvarcutler' setting is the most accurate, but most computationally expensive.  'bilinear' is computationally inexpensive but inaccurate.  'passthrough' shows the received Bayer pattern on the image sensor.
